2.0.3 Begonia
==============

This is the third patch in the Begonia 2.0 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Use cinder as a glance store for NetApp NFS storage.

In previous versions, PVC was created and used as the image store
for glance when using NetApp NFS storage.
It took a long time to create a cinder volume from the image
because the NFS volumes using glance and cinder are different.

To make the creation more efficient,
we changed the setting to use cinder as the glance image store.
