1.4.0 Aster
============

This is the first release in the Aster 1.4 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Include `Asklepios auth-healing service
  <https://github.com/iorchard/asklepios>`_.
  It detects a node failure and quickly moves pods from that node 
  to other nodes to minimize service failure.

* Enhance rabbitmq connection settings for openstack services to minimize
  communication problems between rabbitmq and openstack services in the event
  of a node failure.
