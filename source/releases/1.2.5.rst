1.2.5 Aster
============

This is the 5th patch in the Aster 1.2 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Add StatefulSet type to cinder-volume and glance-api in 
  addition to Deployment type. The default type is Deployment.
* Add PVC to cinder-volume and glance-api to prevent node root filesystem
  from being used by OpenStack volume-to-image conversion operation.

  The PVC in cinder-volume is mounted at /var/lib/cinder/conversion and the
  PVC in glance-api is mounted at /var/cache/nginx/client_temp in nginx
  frontend container.

  The PVC access mode is set by what the default storage backend is.

  If the default storage backend is netapp,
  the PVC access mode is set to ReadWriteMany and the default deployment type
  is used for cinder-volume and glance-api.

  If the default storage backend is ceph or powerflex,
  the PVC access mode is set to ReadWriteOnce and the StatefulSet type is 
  used for cinder-volume and glance-api.

* Remove localrepo and registry haproxy config files when running clean_k8s.sh
  since the localrepo and registry pods are already gone 
  when cleaning kubernetes cluster.
