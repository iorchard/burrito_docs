1.3.3 Aster
============

This is the third patch in the Aster 1.3 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Add the calico images to the genesis registry. 
  When a node boots, calico-kube-controller sometimes fails to run 
  because the calico images cannot be downloaded from the local registry.

* Override nodeSelector in coredns and calico-kube-controller deployment.
  The default nodeSelector is "kubernetes.io/os: linux" so coredns and
  calico-kube-controller could run on kubernetes worker nodes.
  So we change the nodeSelector with 
  'node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane: ""' 
  so that they run on kubernetes control nodes.
