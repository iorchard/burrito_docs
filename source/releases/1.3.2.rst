1.3.2 Aster
============

This is the second patch in the Aster 1.3 series.

We will freeze the features with this version which means we will not 
add any new features, just for bug fixes and patch-level upgrade for 
each component if it is EOL'ed.

The next release series will be Begonia 2.0 series.

* Upgrade mariadb to 10.6.16.

* Upgrade btx to 1.2.3. (btx project)
