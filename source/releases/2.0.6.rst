2.0.6 Begonia
==============

This is the 6th patch in the Begonia 2.0 series.

Notable Changes
----------------

There was an nova configuration issue when netapp was the default
storage.

We changed the default glance store type from `file` to `cinder`
When netapp is the default storage.

And there is `volume_use_multipath` config in libvirt section of
nova.conf.
It is set to true when glance store type is cinder.

There will be an error when nova-compute tries to attach the volume since
multipath is not working for netapp NFS backend.

We added enable_multipath variable which is used by `volume_use_multipath`
variable to fix this problem.

Changelog
----------

* upgrade btx to 2.0.2; btx: add persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy to Retain in statefulset.yaml; (jijisa@iorchard.net)
* fix(openstack): add enable_multipath variable in vars.yml.sample; it is used by libvirt in nova.conf; (jijisa@iorchard.net)
