1.4.2 Aster
============

This is the second patch in the Aster 1.4 series.

Notable changes
----------------

* Fix: cinder as a glance store for NFS

This is a quick fix for cinder as a glance store for NFS.

There is `a bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance-store/+bug/2000584>`_
in glance-store 3.0.1 python package which is the default package 
in OpenStack yoga.

Due to this bug, there is a problem with uploading an image 
if the cinder backend is NFS.
The bug is fixed in glance-store 4.3.0 or later.

So we rebuilt the glance image with glance-store 4.3.3.
