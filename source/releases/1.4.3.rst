1.4.3 Aster
============

This is the 3rd patch in the Aster 1.4 series.

Notable changes
----------------

Set the value of `heartbeat_in_pthread` depending on the service types.
It should be true for wsgi services and false for non-wsgi services.

* Set heartbeat_in_pthread to true for wsgi services like keystone, 
  cinder-api, and nova-api.
* Set heartbeat_in_pthread to false in nova-compute, nova-conductor, and
  nova-scheduler since these services are not wsgi services.
* Set heartbeat_in_pthread to false in cinder-scheduler and
  cinder-volume since these services are not wsgi services.
